# grepy

#A note: I unfortunately can't finish this project. I've been dedicating all of my time to it recently but I've hit a roadblock and I can't figure out how to solve it. I can generate the NFA and gnerate the states of the DFA (in most cases), but figuring out the transitions has proved to be too difficult to do in the given time. Sorry that it's incomplete.
